# How It Works?

### Intro
> Well, its not that complicated. That has two languages running at the same time. One is the python's [flask framework](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) running on localhost, and other is the [electronjs framework](https://electronjs.org) that interacts with the user (in short, the application).

#### Why Python?
> Python is one of the best backend language that is almost used in all the fields and is constantly updated. It has a vast list of modules that are opensource and has almost all access that a developer needs in an OS.

#### Why Flask?
> Flask is a web development framework that is very simple and neat. It has simple routing and is perfect for light weight web apps.

#### Why Javascript, HTML and CSS?
> When it comes to UI or Frontend, there is no other language like HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT that can make a user admire the look. So to make users feel comfortable with the SQILITE3-UI, which is a UI-less database language we use HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT.

### Why Electronjs?
> Now, our goal is to create an app (`executable file`) that can run offline too. We also need a good UI and the use of backend. So, we have JAVASCRIPT that is a language hanging between frontend and backend. And Electronjs is a framework that can be used to create application with HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPTS along with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org). And JAVSCRIPT can send requests to servers, change and interact with the userinterface. So the elctronjs is the solutaion for creating an application for SQLITE3-UI.
